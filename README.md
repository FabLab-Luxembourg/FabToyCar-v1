The OScar (FabToyCar) is an open source project developed in the <a href="http://www.technoport.lu/fablab/" target="_blank">Technoport | FabLab Luxembourg</a>.

3 mutations of the initial laser cut toy car were generated to provide a program for the 3 cycles of FabLab Kids SUD workshops during the 2nd trimester 2014. The latest version of this project (a robotic one) was conceived during the <a href="http://fabjam.org/projects/fab-toy-car-v-3-0" target="_blank">FabJam 2014</a> and the results are presented at the <a href="https://www.fab10.org/en/fab-festival" target="_blank">Fab10 Festival</a> 2014.

The 1st version of this project is launched now in Open Design under a Creative Commons 4.0 (CC-BY-SA) and you can DOWNLOAD the files right here.

All you need to fabricate this car is:

1. download the dxf files.
2. find a 4mm thick PMMA (acrylic) sheet.
3. go to a FabLab or try to find a laser cutter in your neighborhood.
4. execute the files and cut your FabToyCar (OSCar-v1)
5. you'll need a <a href="https://www.tinkersoup.de/motoren-robotics/hobby-motor-gear/a-941/" target="_blank">DC motor</a>, wires and a 2xAA battery pack.
